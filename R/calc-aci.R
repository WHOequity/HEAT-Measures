######### Absolute Concentration Index (ACI)
# Is a measures of the covariance between social rank and health. It measures the extent to which health/illness 
# is concentrated among groups on the absolute scale.  It may only be used with groups that have a natural ordering (p.9);
# e.g., income quintiles, levels of education, etc.
